The violence isnât explicit and exists on the peripherals of what is otherwise a brilliant and captivating read. The main character, Katniss, is incredible.  She's strong, proud, clever, yet cold, calculating and soft.  As far as great female characters go, she rivals Elizabeth Bennet and takes her thrown for my favourite ever.

Thank you.\\n\\nOriginal, 2008 This book was recommended to me after I read Unwind by Neal Shusterman and although maybe it is not as emotionally affecting as Unwind, I still think it is a fantastic book. The story has just the perfect combination of action, drama, and romance. It has a great message that you can stay human even in the most inhumane conditions. Needless to say, I am anxiously awaiting the sequel. I am sure even greater things are to come in the next book. Update 9/09.

Will she walk out of the Games alive? So, I've been avoiding the Hunger Games for years.  It has several strikes against it: 1. It's a young adult book 2. The enormous amount of hype 3.

Though I enjoyed \"The Glass Castle,\" \"The Host,\" and others there was nothing that I thought could match the \"Twilight\" fever. Suddenly this fall, I have read two books that I think are absolutely outstanding. One of them is \"The Hunger Games.\" I was finishing the book in the waiting room at the doctor's office and gasping out loud, laughing out lo ...more\\n\\nI want to scream to the top of my lungs and say that: THIS BOOK IS BEYOND AWESOME!!!!! Okay so maybe not that much excitement is needed, but boy this book deserves a review I probably won't be able to give. There are plenty of good reviews of this book already, but I can't resist the urge to put my own two cents in too. You can already get the premise of the story from the other reviews so I won't bother with that. Can I just say that the author did an exquisite job of finding the right voice f ...more\\n\\nhaha I felt the same way when I finished THG:)\\n\\nHow do you feel the book would have been different if Katniss was more held back and not as outspoken?
